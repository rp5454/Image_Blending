This project integrates modern web technologies (React.js, Node.js, Python) to create an interactive and user-friendly application. The use of OpenCV for image processing, combined with efficient backend handling using Express and multer, ensures a seamless user experience. Optimization strategies like asynchronous processing and static file serving contribute to the applicationâ€™s performance and responsiveness.
